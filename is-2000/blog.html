      <h2 class="title">Why My Swim Club (And I) Needed SECI</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>A large part of my life here on campus consists of the NU Swim Club, of which I am currently the president. A team of 70 people (run by 10 board members) we like to have fun, but a lot of members are competitive and care deeply about their event times and progress throughout a season. For this purpose the team has always maintained a website that shows swimmers’ best times and events grouped by season.</p>
        <p>Always, that is, until 2 years ago when our website was (unbeknownst to us) removed from Northeastern’s servers. As a CS major with some Wordpress Theme development experience I happily volunteered to start work on a WordPress site that would replace our old site and add the functionality of a blog.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t too long until I had a (mostly) working theme built with some cool functionality that would allow people who weren’t web developers to contribute blogs and announcements to the site! I personally held a meeting and taught them how to use it. It was a hit!</p>
        <p>Things went smoothly for a year, and then as is always the case, the board had turnover and out went the people who knew how to use my cool new website tools. Suddenly the website was out of date, and even the fancy integration with our timing software was starting to fall apart due to misuse.</p>
        <p>I am embarrassed to say that when this started to happen my response was to try to teach the new people. I held another meeting and, you guessed it, it was a hit again! Then a year came and went, and so I explained some more. As the sole architect of the whole system I was certainly a good explainer, but this was not my problem.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward a year and there I am sitting in IS-2000 where for the first time I am forced to really think about the different ways in which information is transferred interpersonally. It’s there that I realize that I spent years writing tens of thousands of lines of code and I forgot the most important file: <b>a ReadMe!</b> People loved having a 1-on-1 lesson, but had I simply written down a detailed explanation of how to perform the primary, let’s say, 5 functions of the website I would have saved everyone hours of time by now. And what’s more, our website would likely be full of content!</p>
        <p>I have to admit that when I first saw that our lecture would be on “information and Knowledge” I rolled my eyes a bit, but I am thrilled to have been very wrong about the importance of this topic. Seeing the SECI model made me truly think about the way knowledge is transferred interpersonally, and as a result I am currently in the process of writing a detailed ReadMe file that will hopefully serve the swim club well for years to come. I'm excited to see what the rest of our course holds in store.</p>
