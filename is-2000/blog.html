      <h2 class="title">Bitcoin Crosses $10K, Blockchain Poised to Become Encryption Standard</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Nov 28, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Before Thanksgiving break we did our unit on information security and privacy in which we addressed lots of ways that cyberattacks can be carried out, and ways to recognize or prevent them.</p>
        <p>This past spring I worked for a blockchain startup in Thailand, and I'm embarassed to say that I spent a solid 6 months working as a lead front-end developer with little-to-no fundamental understanding of how blockchain worked. It's a chain of blocks! It's distributed! I could sound smart to friends and family, but really I failed to do my due diligence.</p>
        <p>Fast-Forward to July when I came back from a month-long break only to find that our initial fintech application, which had no tie to cryptocurrencies whatsoever (and therefore allowed me to work with such a limited understanding of them), was looking to move on my boss's long-time goal of doing an ICO. In July they were hot in the streets and so as I was debriefed after my month off, I realized I couldn't fake it anymore. I had to put in the time to understand blockchain and Bitcoin.</p>
        <p>As someone who now keeps tabs on blockchain news and has a rather good understanding of it, I do believe that Blockchain is without a doubt going to fundamentally change the way data and value are stored and exchanged in the world. Lots of companies could benefit from having a system which ensures the integrity of certain data while allowing groups of people to interact with it simultaneously. In cryptocurrencies it's a ledger with transactions, for my co-op it was a way to store identity documents, and I bet that for thousands of companies it will serve different functions in the coming years. A few new slides should be added to the deck!!</p>

      <h2 class="title">MBTA to Eliminate Charlie Cards by 2020 - How the Process Flow Changes</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Nov 21, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The MBTA is the favorite organization of few people in this world, and that's not ususally without good reason. Personally I go back-and-forth between hating the T for being slow and unreliable, and then occasionally stepping back and appreciating the convenience of public transportation in this city. Either way one thing everyone can agree on is that Charlie Cards are somehow extremely hard to come by. Once a rider has a personal Charlie Card then it's pretty smooth sailing! The MBTA lets you put money on your card at any major station, as well as online. Having done both I can confirm that loading money these ways is simple, and the hardest part of the process is undoubtedly getting the card itself.</p>
        <p>I won't go so far as to assume that this is why the MBTA announced this week a plan to get rid of Charlie Cards in the coming years, I believe to be replaced by a mobile app. I'm guessing they will be making money off of this switch somehow (or else why do it, but I'm a cynic) but if the app is built correctly and the trains adjusted well, this could remove the biggest painpoint in the MBTA's user flow. I konw that we're starting to look at processes and flowcharts, and it seems as though if the MBTA had conducted some internal review of the user process, it could have led them to this exact decision. Suddenly anybody could move to Boston and use the T witout waiting weeks to find a station agent who miraculously has Charlie Cards available.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Black Mirror & The Importance of Educated Internet Users</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Nov 5, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In class this week we went through the slide deck for Information Security and Privacy, and one key topic for me was Malware. As someone who has been on sites like 'putlocker' before, I'm very aware of how much malware exists on the internet, but in my mind it is almost always in the form of a pop-up or conspicuous ad.</p>
        <p>Having always thought, for this reason, that nobody really clicked on malware, I was reminded by the lecture that malware can also be designed to appear as helpful software and can be sought out by unsuspecting users.</p>
        <p>This concept was explored in much greater detail in an episode of Black Mirror in which a rather ordinary teenage boy accidentally downloads malware. After his sister tries to pirate a movie on his computer he searches "how to remove malware" and clicks the first link, installing malware by doing so. His webcam is used to capture embarassing footage, and the rest of the hour-long episode consists of him being horrifically extorted until he tries unsuccessfully to take his own life.</p>
        <p>As a viewer my knee-jerk reaction was that the episode portrayed an incredibly dark world ... but since I viewed the episode on Saturday (3 days after our lecture on this exact subject) I quickly realized that everything in the episode was entirely feasable at this point in time. The reality is that hackers could easily construct malware disguised as useful software, and then use it to capture blackmail against a person.</p>
        <p>If we are to consider this possibility a problem (as I think most people would), then either hackers need to be stopped, which has historically proven difficult, or internet users need to be smarter and more aware when it comes to any interaction that could involve malware. Of course some attacks are clever enough to evade even the smartest of users, but the majority are easily avoidable and it's not unreasonable to think that all people could be taught telltale signs of a threatening interaction. Maybe one day hackers will get bored and take up a new hobby, but until then the best way to stop the spread of malware seems to be educating the everyday users of the internet.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Databases and the Changing Understanding of Gender & Sexuality</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Oct 8, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In database, or even just ontology design we are encouraged to have a good grasp on the data we will work with before we finalize our ontology and create a relational database. This strategy is practically infallable when you deal with data which has certain constraints that are known.</p>
        <p>What happens, however, when data which society has known for a long time to be a certain way changes? For decades society (and therefore databases and software solutions) has categorized gender and sexuality in binary terms. M or F. A literal 0 or 1, if you will.</p>
        <p>As we have come to better understand these things and have listened to those who feel unfairly represented by the binary terms, and as a society (maybe this is optimistic but bear with me) our understandings and opinions have changed! So then, should our software.</p>
        <p>The swim club here uses software to help organize and run our meets, and as I was entering new swimmers into the database this year I noticed that the software (granted it's almost 10 years old) doesn't account for sexes other than 'M' or 'F'. At the time of it's creation perhaps  nobody was thinking about how this may be a problem, but in reality that no longer properly represents the real-world data. Thankfully we don't use this part of the software, but I know that many companies are struggling to restructure their databases to accommodate users with non-binary genders or sexualities and are wishing that their databases had been made more flexible in the first place.</p>
        <p>In this specific case I don't pretend to know the perfect solution, but it's hardly a bold argument that history repeats itself, and my question is: what will be the next seemingly simple thing thing which will change fundamentally and leave us scrambling to restructure our databases. And more importantly: how can we be proactive and build software which can be prepared for these changes? People with the answers to these questions, if they exist at all, have lots of experience and insight. While I have a bounty of neither of these things, I hope that as I gain experience setting up databases I will keep in mind ways to future-proof my data and save valuable time down the road.</p>

      <h2 class="title">The World Through a Schema Lens</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Oct 1, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It’s often funny for me to remember what it was like before I wrote my first “hello world” html file in 8th grade (with the help of my now current boss, and good friend). Sure, the world is 8 years older and things have changed considerably, but so many things which are objectively the same seem so different to me now that I am used to the structured nature of functions and the punishing syntax of Angular. It is indisputable that not only do I approach problems differently, but I see the world in a more structured way - as if I were about to take everything and start putting it into UML diagrams.</p>

        <p>For this reason especially I found this week’s lesson on UML interesting and relevant. I remember being introduced toSQL databases through PHP MyAdmin in my first high school internship and being very overwhelmed and confused. Eventually after 2 summers building websites for that company I managed to query and insert data with some competency, but in hindsight my understanding was still very limited and I would have been hopeless trying to create a schema from real-world data on my own. I wasn’t yet seeing the world through a schema lens.</p>

        <p>Database Design here at NEU was a game changer in that regard. Suddenly we were tasked with taking real world situations and devising schemas that would allow us all of the desired functionality. I learned fast (sort-of) that just making things into tables and seeing what happens ends in frustration. Only with a full understanding of the data at hand, the desired end functionality, and after some planning and diagraming was success possible. This class was when I started to see things in the real world and imagine them in data tables. My first co-op office had employees and clients and management and lots of mapping tables. West Village has Buildings, Residents, Staff, etc.</p>

        <p>Most recently I have been trying to create a practice tool to further my skills with a guitar. It’s a passion of mine and now that I can play a few songs to impress my friends I know that I should study music theory and understand why the guitar works the way that it does. Unfortunately this means starting by memorizing what note or pitch is made by each fret of each string of the guitar. I’m making a local web-app to aid in my memorization, and along the way I was forced to turn my favorite instrument into a database schema. Life has gotten busy and I haven’t finished the app (or practiced enough guitar) but the framework is there and having created that it’s now fun to go to class and reflect back on a time before I could make a UML diagram. It really is an invaluable skill for developers.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Why My Swim Club (And I) Needed SECI</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Sep 13, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A large part of my life here on campus consists of the NU Swim Club, of which I am currently the president. A team of 70 people (run by 10 board members) we like to have fun, but a lot of members are competitive and care deeply about their event times and progress throughout a season. For this purpose the team has always maintained a website that shows swimmers’ best times and events grouped by season.</p>
        <p>Always, that is, until 2 years ago when our website was (unbeknownst to us) removed from Northeastern’s servers. As a CS major with some Wordpress Theme development experience I happily volunteered to start work on a WordPress site that would replace our old site and add the functionality of a blog.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t too long until I had a (mostly) working theme built with some cool functionality that would allow people who weren’t web developers to contribute blogs and announcements to the site! I personally held a meeting and taught them how to use it. It was a hit!</p>
        <p>Things went smoothly for a year, and then as is always the case, the board had turnover and out went the people who knew how to use my cool new website tools. Suddenly the website was out of date, and even the fancy integration with our timing software was starting to fall apart due to misuse.</p>
        <p>I am embarrassed to say that when this started to happen my response was to try to teach the new people. I held another meeting and, you guessed it, it was a hit again! Then a year came and went, and so I explained some more. As the sole architect of the whole system I was certainly a good explainer, but this was not my problem.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward a year and there I am sitting in IS-2000 where for the first time I am forced to really think about the different ways in which information is transferred interpersonally. It’s there that I realize that I spent years writing tens of thousands of lines of code and I forgot the most important file: <b>a ReadMe!</b> People loved having a 1-on-1 lesson, but had I simply written down a detailed explanation of how to perform the primary, let’s say, 5 functions of the website I would have saved everyone hours of time by now. And what’s more, our website would likely be full of content!</p>
        <p>I have to admit that when I first saw that our lecture would be on “information and Knowledge” I rolled my eyes a bit, but I am thrilled to have been very wrong about the importance of this topic. Seeing the SECI model made me truly think about the way knowledge is transferred interpersonally, and as a result I am currently in the process of writing a detailed ReadMe file that will hopefully serve the swim club well for years to come. I'm excited to see what the rest of our course holds in store.</p>
