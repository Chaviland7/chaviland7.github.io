      <h2 class="title">Why My Swim Club (And I) Needed SECI</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Sep 13, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A large part of my life here on campus consists of the NU Swim Club, of which I am currently the president. A team of 70 people (run by 10 board members) we like to have fun, but a lot of members are competitive and care deeply about their event times and progress throughout a season. For this purpose the team has always maintained a website that shows swimmers’ best times and events grouped by season.</p>
        <p>Always, that is, until 2 years ago when our website was (unbeknownst to us) removed from Northeastern’s servers. As a CS major with some Wordpress Theme development experience I happily volunteered to start work on a WordPress site that would replace our old site and add the functionality of a blog.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t too long until I had a (mostly) working theme built with some cool functionality that would allow people who weren’t web developers to contribute blogs and announcements to the site! I personally held a meeting and taught them how to use it. It was a hit!</p>
        <p>Things went smoothly for a year, and then as is always the case, the board had turnover and out went the people who knew how to use my cool new website tools. Suddenly the website was out of date, and even the fancy integration with our timing software was starting to fall apart due to misuse.</p>
        <p>I am embarrassed to say that when this started to happen my response was to try to teach the new people. I held another meeting and, you guessed it, it was a hit again! Then a year came and went, and so I explained some more. As the sole architect of the whole system I was certainly a good explainer, but this was not my problem.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward a year and there I am sitting in IS-2000 where for the first time I am forced to really think about the different ways in which information is transferred interpersonally. It’s there that I realize that I spent years writing tens of thousands of lines of code and I forgot the most important file: <b>a ReadMe!</b> People loved having a 1-on-1 lesson, but had I simply written down a detailed explanation of how to perform the primary, let’s say, 5 functions of the website I would have saved everyone hours of time by now. And what’s more, our website would likely be full of content!</p>
        <p>I have to admit that when I first saw that our lecture would be on “information and Knowledge” I rolled my eyes a bit, but I am thrilled to have been very wrong about the importance of this topic. Seeing the SECI model made me truly think about the way knowledge is transferred interpersonally, and as a result I am currently in the process of writing a detailed ReadMe file that will hopefully serve the swim club well for years to come. I'm excited to see what the rest of our course holds in store.</p>

      <h2 class="title">The World Through a Schema Lens</h2>
      <h4 class="date">Oct 1, 2017</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It’s often funny for me to remember what it was like before I wrote my first “hello world” html file in 8th grade (with the help of my now current boss, and good friend). Sure, the world is 8 years older and things have changed considerably, but so many things which are objectively the same seem so different to me now that I am used to the structured nature of functions and the punishing syntax of Angular. It is indisputable that not only do I approach problems differently, but I see the world in a more structured way - as if I were about to take everything and start putting it into UML diagrams.</p>

        <p>For this reason especially I found this week’s lesson on UML interesting and relevant. I remember being introduced toSQL databases through PHP MyAdmin in my first high school internship and being very overwhelmed and confused. Eventually after 2 summers building websites for that company I managed to query and insert data with some competency, but in hindsight my understanding was still very limited and I would have been hopeless trying to create a schema from real-world data on my own. I wasn’t yet seeing the world through a schema lens.</p>

        <p>Database Design here at NEU was a game changer in that regard. Suddenly we were tasked with taking real world situations and devising schemas that would allow us all of the desired functionality. I learned fast (sort-of) that just making things into tables and seeing what happens ends in frustration. Only with a full understanding of the data at hand, the desired end functionality, and after some planning and diagraming was success possible. This class was when I started to see things in the real world and imagine them in data tables. My first co-op office had employees and clients and management and lots of mapping tables. West Village has Buildings, Residents, Staff, etc.</p>

        <p>Most recently I have been trying to create a practice tool to further my skills with a guitar. It’s a passion of mine and now that I can play a few songs to impress my friends I know that I should study music theory and understand why the guitar works the way that it does. Unfortunately this means starting by memorizing what note or pitch is made by each fret of each string of the guitar. I’m making a local web-app to aid in my memorization, and along the way I was forced to turn my favorite instrument into a database schema. Life has gotten busy and I haven’t finished the app (or practiced enough guitar) but the framework is there and having created that it’s now fun to go to class and reflect back on a time before I could make a UML diagram. It really is an invaluable skill for developers.</p>
